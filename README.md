# CV Builder
A CV builder with similar functionalities to Zety, the resume maker website.

## Why
I started this project by following the instructions listed 
in The Odin Project's CV builder assignment. However, I was later
inspired by the layout of the resume maker website, Zety, and attempted to 
replicate it with my current React development skills. 

Prior to this project, I'd heard about how forms in React behave 
differently to their HTML counterparts in regards to form state management. Thus,
I wanted to do a web application that mainly revolves around forms. I also
wanted to use Formik and Yup in one of my projects so I thought, 
why not a CV builder?

## Tools
Formik, Yup, Routers, React-To-Print, TailwindCSS

## Future Updates
I wanted to use Redux to manage data and the states of the React components.

I also want to integrate 3 more functionalities into this web application. 
* Built-in template designs: Pre-installed resume designs that users 
can choose from once they are done with the neccessary information.
* Authentication and Database: Users can log in and out while using the website. 
If logged in, all data will be saved to an external database.
* Dark Mode: Users can toggle between light and dark mode via a button.
